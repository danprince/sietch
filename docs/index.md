Sietch is a markdown powered static site generator that can render components at build time, with opt-in runtime interactivity.

It is ideal for blog posts with interactive examples that can be pre-rendered. Visit [get started](./get-started.md) if you're ready to jump in.

Sietch has an uncompromising set of principles.

1. ### Build a blog, not a spaceship
    No plugins. No dynamic data sources. No taxonomies. No decisions.
2. ### Small
    No plugins. No dynamic data sources. No taxonomies. No decisions.
3. ### Stylish, but not too stylish
    The default theme is readable, but you can provide your own stylesheet and template file instead.
