- #### How do I extend Sietch?
    You don't. You can change the way it looks and renders with a [custom template](templates.html), but you can't change the way it works.
- #### What flavour of markdown is supported?
    Sietch supports [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) with the [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and [Footnotes](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#footnotes) extensions.
- #### What does Sietch mean?
    A sietch is a home in an otherwise inhospitable desert landscape (borrowed from [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel))).
- #### Have these questions really been asked frequently?
    No. Stop being cheeky.
