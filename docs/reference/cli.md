### `sietch`
Run `sietch` to create a production ready build of a site. The pages will be minified and the code for any islands will be minified and fingerprinted ready for deployment.

The output will be built into a directory called `_site`.

### `--serve`
Use `sietch --serve` to serve a site locally, watch for changes and automatically refresh the browser after rebuilding.
